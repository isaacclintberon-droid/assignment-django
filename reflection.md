# Reflection

While setting up my Django project, I experienced a lot of challenges. The most difficult part was that I encountered errors multiple times while coding. I tried to fix them on my own, but after failing three times, I had to keep going back to the video lessons of my instructor and also search on YouTube for solutions. Even after watching, I still couldnâ€™t fully solve the issue on the first day. I spent around four hours coding and troubleshooting, but I eventually decided to stop because I was frustrated and tired.

The next day, I came back with a clearer mind and tried again. This time, I carefully reviewed the tutorials and re-checked my previous mistakes. After repeating the steps slowly and understanding where I went wrong, I was finally able to fix the error and run my Django project successfully.

This experience taught me the value of patience and persistence in coding. Sometimes, it takes multiple attempts and repeated learning to really understand the process. In the end, the struggles made me more confident and proud of finishing the setup on my own.
